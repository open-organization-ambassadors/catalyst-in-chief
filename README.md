## About the book

One year after the publication of _The Open Organization_, Red Hat President and CEO Jim Whitehurst explains what the community of innovative thinkers, writers, and practitioners that coalesced around his writing have taught him about the future of management and work.

_Catalyst-In-Chief_ collects Jim's contributions to the ongoing conversation about the ways open source principles can form the bedrock of the twenty-first century's most innovative organizationsâ€”and teaches tomorrow's leaders what they'll need to make those organizations great.
